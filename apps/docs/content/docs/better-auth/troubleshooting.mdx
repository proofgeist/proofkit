import { CliCommand } from "@/components/CliCommand";

## Error when generating schema
```bash
ERROR [Better Auth]: filemaker is not supported. If it is a custom adapter, please request the maintainer to implement createSchema
```

This means you used the better-auth CLI directly instead of the @proofkit/better-auth version. Run this instead:

<CliCommand command="migrate" exec packageName="@proofkit/better-auth" />
