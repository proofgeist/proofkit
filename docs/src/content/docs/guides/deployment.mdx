ProofKit applications are designed to be deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), a platform that makes it easy to deploy web applications with minimal configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying your application, you'll need:

1. A [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) - Free tier is available
2. Your ProofKit application ready for deployment

You don't need to install the Vercel CLI beforehand - ProofKit will automatically install it for you if it's not already present on your system.

<Aside type="tip">
  This command is indeded to be run locally on your computer. We suggest using
  Vercel's built-in GitHub integration for automatic deployments.
</Aside>

## Deploying Your Application

To deploy your application, run:

<CliCommand command="proofkit deploy" frame="none" />

During the deployment process, ProofKit will:

1. Check for and install the Vercel CLI if needed
2. Ensure your Node.js version is properly configured
3. Build your application for production
4. Deploy your application to Vercel

## After Deployment

Once deployment is complete, you'll receive:

- A URL where your application is live
- A link to your project dashboard on Vercel

From the Vercel dashboard, you can:

- Configure custom domains
- Set up environment variables
- Monitor application performance
- View deployment logs

<Aside type="note">
  Your first deployment will create a new project in your Vercel account.
  Subsequent deployments will update the same project.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

When you run `proofkit deploy`, your application will first be built locally before being deployed to Vercel. This local build process helps catch any errors before the deployment begins.

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures

If your build fails, check the terminal output for:

- Missing dependencies in `package.json`
- Syntax errors in your code
- TypeScript or ESLint errors (warnings are okay, they won't cause the build to fail)

<Aside type="tip">
  Running `pnpm build` locally before deploying can help identify issues early
  in the development process.
</Aside>

#### Environment Variables

Make sure all required environment variables are:

- Set up in your local `.env` file for testing
- Configured in your Vercel project settings for production

If you added any new environment variables after running the `deploy` command for the first time, you may need to manually add these new variables to your Vercel project settings.
