title: Typegen UI
---

The typegen tool has a built-in web interface for editing your JSON config file and running the typegen scripts. It's helpful for making sure your environment variables are setup correctly and can help autocomplete layout/field/table names into the config file.

To launch the UI, run the following command and a browser window will open at `http://localhost:3141`:

```bash
npx @proofkit/typegen@beta ui
```


## CLI options

The UI can be configured with the following CLI options:

### `--port <number>`
Set the port for the UI server.

### `--config <filename>`
Set a custom filename/path for where the config file is located or will be created. The file name must end with either `jsonc` or `json`.

### `--no-open`
Don't automatically open the browser.
