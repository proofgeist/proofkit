# ProofKit NextJS Template

This is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with `@proofgeist/kit`

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

While this template is designed to be a minimal starting point, the proofkit CLI will guide you through adding additional features and pages.

To add new things to your project, simply run `@proofgeist/kit` inside the project directory.
