import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Here's a brief overview of the folder structure you should expect to see in a ProofKit project. Not all files are shown in the diagram


<Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
  <Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="(main)" defaultOpen>
      <File name="page.tsx" />
      <File name="layout.tsx" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="components" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" defaultOpen>
      <File name="button.tsx" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="config" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="schemas">
      <File name="..." />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="theme">
      <File name="..." />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  
  <Folder name="server" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="data" >
      <File name="..." />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="services" >
      <File name="..." />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="utils" />
    
</Folder>


# Conventions

The ProofKit CLI expects a certain structure for it to be able to inject code into your project.

- Wherever you see an **internal** folder, you should never touch the code inside. The ProofKit CLI may overwrite its contents when adding a new component or switching layouts.
- Any file that begins with `slot-` is designed to be edited, but you should never rename the functions or delete the file. If you don't want to render anything in the slot, simply return null from the Slot function

## The `src` directory

This is where your application code lives. Files outside of the `src` folder are for configuation only.

## The `src/app` directory

This is the Next.js app router. Learn more at the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing), and make sure you're looking at the guides for "using the app router".

In here you'll primarily be working in the `(main)` folder. This is a seperate folder that doesn't show in your URL, but groups pages together that should use the app shell layout (navbar, header, etc).

## The `src/server` directory

Code in this folder should only ever run on the server. It's where you can write functions that access your database, or interact with other services that use a shared API key that you don't want exposed to the web browser.

- `src/server/data` is where you can put functions that interact with your database.
- `src/server/services` is where you can put functions that interact with other services.
- `src/server/safe-action.ts` is where the next-safe-action client is defined, and used as the base for all server actions.

<Callout>
  Keep in mind that other code from the `components` and `app` directories may
  also be executed on the server, such as React Server Components or when a page
  is server-side rendered. But the server directory is for code that should
  _only_ run on the server and can include sensitive information like API keys.
</Callout>

## The `src/components` directory

A folder for your application's UI components. Components may also exist in the `app` directory if they are only used on a single page, but this folder is for components that may be used across multiple pages. Subfolders may be used within this folder to group components by feature, theme, or similar.

## The `src/config` directory

A place to store app-wide configuration and types. This is where you'll find the theme settings for the Mantine components, as well as the generated types and Zod schemas used for data validation from your data sources.

<Callout type="caution">
  The `config` directory contains a lot of generated code. Be careful not to
  modify these generated files directly as they may be overwritten.
</Callout>

## The `src/utils` directory

A folder for helper functions to be used throughout your application.
