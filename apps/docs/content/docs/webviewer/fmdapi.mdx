We can use the `Execute FileMaker Data API` script step to harness the power of the [@proofkit/fmdapi](/docs/fmdapi) library in our webviewer integration.

- ✅ Use the same code and functions as in a browsed-based app
  - including typegen for a nice auto-complete experience and runtime validation for protection if field names are changed.
- ✅ No authentication required (it runs in the process of the logged in user)
- ✅ Works in offline FileMaker apps
- ✅ Works even if the Data API is disabled on the server

## Setup

<Callout type="info">
  If you used the [ProofKit CLI](/docs/cli) to create your project, these steps
  are already done for you.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install both packages

    ```package-install
    @proofkit/fmdapi @proofkit/webviewer
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
  ### FileMaker Script Installation

    Copy the `ExecuteDataAPI` and `SendCallback` scripts from the [demo file](/fmdapi-demo.fmp12) to your own FileMaker solution.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Initialize the DataAPI client

    <Callout type="info">
      For more details about this step, see the [@proofkit/fmdapi](/docs/fmdapi) documentation.
    </Callout>

    <Accordions defaultValue="typegen">
      <Accordion title="Using Typegen (recommended)" value="typegen">
        If you're using using [typegen](/docs/fmdapi/typegen), modify your `fmschema.config.mjs` file to include the script name that calls the `Execute FileMaker Data API` script step

        ```js title="fmschema.config.mjs"
        export const config = {
          //  ...other config
          webviewerScriptName: "ExecuteDataApi",
        };
        ```
        Then simply run the typegen command to generate the client.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Manual Setup" value="manual">
        If you're manually creating the client, use the webviewer adapter from the `@proofkit/webviewer` package.

        ```ts title="client.ts"
        import { DataApi } from "@proofkit/fmdapi";
        import { WebViewerAdapter } from "@proofkit/webviewer/adapter";

        export const client = DataApi({
          adapter: new WebViewerAdapter({ scriptName: "ExecuteDataApi" }),
          layout: "API_Customers", // put your layout name here
        });

        ```

        Repeat this for each layout that you want to interact with.
      </Accordion>
    </Accordions>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Now you can use the DataAPI client just as you would in a browsed-based app!

```ts
import { UsersClient } from "./schema/client";

const users = await UsersClient.findOne({ query: { id: "===1234" } });
```

For examples of all methods, see the [@proofkit/fmdapi](/docs/fmdapi) documentation.
