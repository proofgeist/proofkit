import CliCommand from "../../../components/CliCommand.astro";

## Installing

From within a ProofKit project, run the following command:

<CliCommand command="proofkit add auth --type=next-auth" frame="none" />

NextAuth requires that some specific tables and layouts exist in your FileMaker file. The CLI will detect if these layouts and not in your file, and notify you to install the NextAuth addon if they are missing.

To easily install the addon, enter Layout mode on any layout and open the "Add-ons" tab in the left pane. Click the + icon in the lower left corner, then select the "NextAuth" addon from the list.

:::caution[Troubleshooting]
If you don't see the addon, try one of these options:

- Quit and re-open FileMaker Pro.
- Re-download the addon using the CLI: <CliCommand command="next-auth-adapter-filemaker@beta install-addon" frame="terminal" type="execute" />
