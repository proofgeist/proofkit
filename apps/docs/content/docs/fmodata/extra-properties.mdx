## Include Special Columns by Default (ROWID and ROWMODID)

FileMaker provides special columns `ROWID` and `ROWMODID` that uniquely identify records and track modifications. These can be included in query responses when enabled.

Enable special columns at the database level:

```typescript
const db = connection.database("MyDatabase", {
  includeSpecialColumns: true,
});

const result = await db.from(users).list().execute();
// result.data[0] will have ROWID and ROWMODID properties
```

Override at the request level:

```typescript
// Enable for this request only
const result = await db.from(users).list().execute({
  includeSpecialColumns: true,
});

// Disable for this request
const result = await db.from(users).list().execute({
  includeSpecialColumns: false,
});
```

<Callout type="warning">
Special columns are only included when no `$select` query is applied (per OData specification). When using `.select()`, special columns are excluded even if `includeSpecialColumns` is enabled.
</Callout>




## OData Annotations

By default, the library automatically strips OData annotations fields (`@id` and `@editLink`) from responses. If you need these fields, you can include them by passing `includeODataAnnotations: true`:

```typescript
const result = await db.from("users").list().execute({
  includeODataAnnotations: true,
});
```
