## Purpose

The goal of this package is to make it easy to work with FileMaker scripts and data when building a custom webviewer integration. @proofkit/webviewer works only inside of webviewer and allows you to interact with your FileMaker solution via local scripts.

This is a **client-side** package, meant to run specifically in a FileMaker WebViewer, but it can still be used in a hosted web app, such as Next.js. However, it will cause errors if loaded in a standard browser. For more information about deployment strategies, see the [Deployment](/docs/deployment) page.

For web-based applications where you're looking to interact with the Data API using a network request, check out the [@proofkit/fmdapi](/docs/fmdapi) package instead.

## Automatic Installation

We strongly recommend using the [ProofKit CLI](/docs/cli) to setup your project. It will also walk you through a FileMaker add-on that installs the neccesary layouts, scripts and custom functions to get you started.
