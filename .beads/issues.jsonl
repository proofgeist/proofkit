Turbo may have cached 'passed' result based on old inputs. Fresh scaffold exposes the missing files.\n\n### Fix needed:\nEnsure CLI registry/templates include all required UI components that generated code imports. Check:\n- `packages/registry/` for component definitions\n- CLI scaffold logic that copies/generates components\n\n### Additional warnings (non-blocking):\n```\nWarning: Invalid input options - For the \"define\". Invalid key: Expected never but received \"define\".\n```\nThis vitest config warning appears twice but doesn't cause failure.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-10T13:34:47.060701-06:00","created_by":"ericluce","updated_at":"2026-01-12T08:12:56.090617-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-10T13:53:21.489937-06:00","close_reason":"Fixed by including shadcn components directly in template instead of fetching at runtime"}
