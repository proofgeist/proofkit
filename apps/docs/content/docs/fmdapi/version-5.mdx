title: Upgrading to v5
---

import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

In v5, we've split the Data API and typegen functionality into two separate packages: `@proofkit/fmdapi` and `@proofkit/typegen`, as well as introduces a few breaking changes.

## Codemod

To make the transition as smooth as possible, we've made an upgrade script to the `@proofgeist/fmdapi`
package. Simply run this command in the root of your project:

```bash
npx @proofgeist/fmdapi@latest upgrade
```

This script will:

- Install the new packages (@proofkit/fmdapi and @proofkit/typegen)
- Remove the old package (@proofgeist/fmdapi)
- Migrate your existing config file to the new format
- Attempt to re-run the typegen command to generate new clients

After running the command, you'll likely want to run `tsc` to check for any issues. You may need to simply do a full project find/replace for `@proofgeist/fmdapi` and replace with `@proofkit/fmdapi`.

We also suggest creating/updating the "typegen" script in your `package.json` file to use the new `@proofkit/typegen` package.

```json
"typegen": "npx @proofkit/typegen"
```

## What's new?

### Validation / Transformations

Zod is no longer required as a peer dependency, and you can now use any library that supports [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/) as your runtime validator. Zod will still be used by the typegen package by default, but only if you want to use it in your runtime application.

Each method called will now also return the result of your validator, so you can define custom transformations if supported by your validation library.

Here's an example of how you might use zod to force a number field to a boolean, or a string to a JavaScript Date:

```ts title="schema/Customers.ts"
import { z } from "zod/v4";
import { ZCustomers as ZCustomers_generated } from "./generated/Customers";
import dayjs from "dayjs";
import customParseFormat from "dayjs/plugin/customParseFormat";
dayjs.extend(customParseFormat);

export const ZCustomers = ZCustomers_generated.omit({ active: true }).extend({
  active: z.coerce.boolean(),
  createdAt: z
    .string()
    .transform((v) => dayjs(v, ["MM/DD/YYYY"]))
    .toDate(),
});
```

```ts title="index.ts"
import { CustomersLayout } from "./schema/client";

const { data } = await CustomersLayout.list();
data[0].fieldData.active; // --> boolean
```

### Typegen

The typegen features have been isolated from the Data API package and are now available as a separate package: `@proofkit/typegen`. The typegen can be run exclusively with npx so you don't even need to install it as a dev dependency. This should make the package size even smaller and more focused on its core functionality.

Additionally, the generated code now allows you to specify overrides for each schema. Only the files in the `client` and `generated` folders will be overwritten, allowing you to write custom schemas or transformers in the files in the root of the generated folder.

## Breaking Changes

### Layout-specific clients only

Due to the change in how the runtime validators are now processed, it's now **required** to pass a layout name when initializing a client, and you can no longer override the layout per method. If you were exclusvily using generated clients from the typegen features, this should not affect you.

### Token Store removed from typegen

This was deprecated in v4 and is now removed **from typegen only**. You can still use a custom token store, but you will need to modify the typegen options and set `generateClient` to `false` so that you can use the generated types and/or validators, but create your own clients with your own token store for the Fetch adapter.

### Typegen config updates

For full details about the new typegen package, please see the [Typegen docs](/docs/typegen).

- Within the root config:
  - `schemas` has been renamed to `layouts`
  - `useZod` has been removed
  - New option: `validator` can be set to `zod` or `false`
- Within the `layouts` config:
  - `layout` has been renamed to `layoutName`
