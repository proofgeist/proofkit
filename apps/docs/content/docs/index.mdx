## What is ProofKit?

The ProofKit CLI aims to make web development easier for beginners and more efficient for experienced devs. It’s opinionated structure allows for more than just a starter template or bootstrapping tool, but code-mod scripts that can modify a project after the initial setup.

ProofKit is not a JavaScript framework. It’s also not the only way to build a web app. It’s simply our experience of building web apps encapsulated into a CLI tool to help you structure your project and add to it over time. Each template is just a starting point, and you are free to modify any part of it as you see fit.

## Core Libraries

The ProofKit CLI will automatically install these other packages for you (depending on what you choose to build), but they are published seperately if you want to use them in your own projects, without the opinionated structure of the CLI.
