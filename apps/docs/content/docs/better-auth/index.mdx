# What is Better-Auth?

From the [Better-Auth](https://better-auth.com) website:
> The most comprehensive authentication framework for TypeScript.

Better-Auth has a robust plugin ecosystem that gives you the ability to pick and choose which authentication methods you want to use, all within a system that let's you securely host your own authentication.

The @proofkit/better-auth package allows you to use FileMaker as the backend database for the better-auth library, including automated schema migrations to easily add any neccesary tables and fields to your FileMaker file.
