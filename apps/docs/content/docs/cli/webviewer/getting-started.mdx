Creating a ProofKit project for a FileMaker WebViewer is extremely similar to the browser-based version as covered in the [main Getting Started guide](/guides/getting-started). This document will simply highlight the key differences.

## Prep your FileMaker file

- The file must be hosted on a FileMaker server running OttoFMS (4.7 or later)
- The server must have the Data API enabled.
- You must have a user account that has the `fmrest` extended privilege enabled.
- The Full Access user account must have the `fmurlscript` extended privilege enabled (Allow URLs to run FileMaker scripts)

<Callout type="info" title="Why does it have to be hosted?">
  The ProofKit CLI uses the metadata endpoint of the Data API to learn about the
  layouts and fields in your file to generate type-safe code that can be used in
  your webviewer. This is only for development though; once you build your web
  code for production, it can interact directly with the FileMaker Pro client
  and will work even offline.

In a future release, we may provide a way to scaffold a new webviewer project for use with local development, but there are other tradeoffs to consider.

## Creating a ProofKit Project

Run the following command to scaffold a new ProofKit project, choosing the `webviewer` option when prompted:

<InitCommand />

Refer to the [main Getting Started guide](/guides/getting-started) for more details on the prompts and options available.

## Install the ProofKit WebViewer Addon

The ProofKit CLI will automatically install the ProofKit WebViewer to your computer, but you must install it into your FileMaker file to receive the necessary tables, layouts, and scripts.

To easily install the add-on, enter Layout mode on any layout and open the "Add-ons" tab in the left pane. Click the + icon in the lower left corner, then select the "ProofKit Auth" add-on from the list.

<Callout type="warning" title="Troubleshooting">
If you don't see the add-on after initialing your project with the CLI, quit and re-open FileMaker Pro.

## Developing with the WebViewer

When you run the dev server with the `dev` command, a localhost URL will be displayed for you to see your project in a browser. **DO NOT OPEN THIS URL IN A BROWSER**

In modern FileMaker versions, the WebViewer is just as capable as any other browser, but if your users are going to exclusively be running this code in a WebViewer, you should also be developing with the the WebViewer as your browser. Plus, it's the only way to test the FileMaker interactions that you will likely build.

Thankfully, the ProofKit WebViewer Addon makes it easy to switch your webviewer from dev mode and production mode.

With your dev server running (e.g. `pnpm dev`), open a **seperate** terminal instance and run:

<CliCommand command="launch-fm" />

which will open your FileMaker file in FileMaker Pro and run the `Launch Web Viewer for Dev` script. This script will ensure that you're on the correct layout and that the WebViewer is running in dev modeâ€”pointing to your localhost URL.

You can use the other utility scripts to build your own version of this behavior:

- **Enable WebDev Mode**: Sets a global variable to indicate that the WebViewer should be running in dev mode, then resets the WebViewer to re-apply it's calculation.
- **Disable WebDev Mode**: Clears the global variable for the WebViewer to return to production mode, then resets the WebViewer to re-apply it's calculation.

To enable the JavaScript debugging in FileMaker Web Viewers, run this command in your terminal, then restart FileMaker Pro:

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="bash" code="defaults write com.filemaker.client.pro12 WebKitDebugDeveloperExtrasEnabled -bool YES" />

## Building for Production

When you're done with development, you need to **build** your project for production and then **upload** the resulting code to your FileMaker file. Use these commands in your project's root directory:

<CliCommand command={["build", "upload", "build:upload"]} />

The final command is simply a shortcut for running the `build` and `upload` commands in sequence.

The `build` command will compile your project into a single html file, which will be output to the `dist` directory.

The `upload` command will use the fmp URL protocol to call a script in your FileMaker file with the path to the html file. The FileMaker script will read the data from that file and insert it into a single-record field in the `ProofKitWV` table.

<Callout type="warning" title="Data Migrations">
If you are working with a seperated Dev/Production environments and running migrations to deploy your code to production, the uploaded code will not transfer to your production environment. See the [Deployment Methods](/webviewer/deployment-methods) page for more details.
