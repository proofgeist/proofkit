## What is ProofKit?
ProofKit is a collection of TypeScript tools and libraries for building modern web applications, with a focus on seamless integration with Claris FileMaker.

The ProofKit CLI aims to make web development easier for beginners and more efficient for experienced devs. Its opinionated structure allows for more than just a starter template or bootstrapping tool, but code-mod scripts that can modify a project after the initial setup.

Think of it as our experience building web apps encapsulated into a CLI tool to help you structure your project and add to it over time. Each template is just a starting point, and you are free to modify any part of it as you see fit.

## Core Libraries

The ProofKit CLI will automatically install these other packages for you (depending on what you choose to build), but they are published separately if you want to use them in your own projects, without the opinionated structure provided by the CLI.
