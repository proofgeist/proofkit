This guide walks you through how to get up and running with a new ProofKit project.

## Prerequisites

If you're brand new to web development, you'll want to make sure these basics are installed on your system

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or similar IDE)
- git (download [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) if you've never used git before)
- _(suggested)_ [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
  - Otherwise you can also use npm, which comes bundled when you install Node

### Data Sources

Additional prerequisites apply depending on which data source you intend to connect to.

#### FileMaker

To connect to FileMaker data, you'll need a FileMaker server (19.6+) running OttoFMS (4.7+). Your server should be accessible via port 443
_Older OttoFMS versions may be supported, but require you to manually provide an Admin API key via the `--adminApiKey` flag_

Your hosted FileMaker file must have an account with the `fmrest` priviledge set enabled. During setup, you'll be asked for either the account namd and password for that file, or a Data API key from OttoFMS. (If you provide credentials, a Data API key will be created for you)

#### Supabase
