ProofKit comes with several built-in page templates that you can use to quickly scaffold new pages in your application. These templates are available through the CLI when you run `proofkit add page`.

Some templates require data from one of your data sources to generate properly and you will be prompted to select a data source and schema if more than one is available in your project. This will allow the template to generate a custom page that is tailored to your data.

Choose your application type to see available templates:

<CardGrid>

  <LinkCard href="/templates/browser" title="Browser Templates" />
  <LinkCard href="/templates/web-viewer" title="WebViewer Templates" />
</CardGrid>
