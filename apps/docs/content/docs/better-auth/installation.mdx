import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";


<Callout type="warning">
This package is currently in beta. Please report any issues you find to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/proofgeist/proofkit/issues), or reach out to us in the [Community](https://community.ottomatic.cloud/c/proofkit/13)
</Callout>


Follow the [Better-Auth installation guide](https://better-auth.com/docs/installation) to get started in your app, but come back here for special instructions for anything related to your Database Setup or schema migrations.

### Database Setup

Ensure you have the @proofkit/better-auth package installed in your app.
```package-install
@proofkit/better-auth
```

Configure your database connection in your `auth.ts` file. Be sure to set these value secrets in your environment variables. The credentials you use here need `fmodata` permissions enabled, and read/write access to the better-auth tables.
```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { FileMakerAdapter } from "@proofkit/better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  database: FileMakerAdapter({
    odata: {
      serverUrl: process.env.FM_SERVER_URL,
      auth: {
        // option 1: username/password credentials
        username: process.env.FM_USERNAME,
        password: process.env.FM_PASSWORD,

        // option 2: Data API key (OttoFMS 4.11+, OData enabled for the key)
        // apiKey: process.env.OTTO_API_KEY,
      },
      database: process.env.FM_DATABASE,
    },
  }),
});
```

### Create Database Tables

Run the following command to create the necessary tables and fields in your FileMaker file.
```bash
pnpm dlx @proofkit/better-auth@latest migrate
```
[Full Access] credentials are required for the schema changes to be applied automatically, but you may want to use a more restricted account for the rest of better-auth usage. If your credentials that you entered eariler in the `auth.ts` file do not have the [Full Access] permissions, you can override them in the CLI.
```bash
pnpm dlx @proofkit/better-auth@latest migrate --username "full_access_username" --password "full_access_password"
```

<Callout type="info">
If you make any schema-related changes to the better-auth config, such as adding plugins, you will need to run the migration command again to apply the changes to your FileMaker file.
</Callout>



## Next Steps

Now that you have your database setup and your tables created, you can continue with the [Better-Auth installation guide](https://better-auth.com/docs/installation) to get your app up and running.
