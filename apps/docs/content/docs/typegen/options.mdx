import { TypeTable } from "fumadocs-ui/components/type-table";

Most configuration can be done with the [config file](/docs/typegen/config) in your project, but some options can be set at runtime.

```bash
npx @proofkit/typegen
```

## Global Options

### `--config <filename>`
Set a custom filename/path for where the config file is located or will be created. The file name must end with either `jsonc` or `json`.

- For `generate`, this specifies where to find the config file.
- For `init`, this specifies where to create the config file.

## `generate` command

```bash
npx @proofkit/typegen generate
```

This is also the default command, so "generate" is optional. If this command is run without any config file detected, you will be prompted to create the config file (the `init` command).

See [Global Options](#global-options) for `--config` usage.

### `--env-path <path>`

Set a custom path for where your environment variables are stored.

### `--reset-overrides`

Recreate the overrides file(s), even if they already exist.

### `--skip-env-check`

Ignore loading environment variables from a file. Use this option if you are injecting environment variables directly as the command runs.

## `init` command

```bash
npx @proofkit/typegen init
```

Use this command to create a config file in the current directory.

See [Global Options](#global-options) for `--config` usage.
