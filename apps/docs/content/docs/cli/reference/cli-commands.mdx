ProofKit comes with a powerful CLI that helps you manage your project. Here's a comprehensive list of available commands.

## Basic Commands

### Initialize a New Project

Create a new ProofKit project:

<CliCommand command="proofkit init" />

### Add Components

Add new components to your project:

<CliCommand command="proofkit add" />

This will prompt you with options to add:

- Pages
- Data Sources
- Schema
- Authentication

See [Adding Components](/docs/cli/guides/adding-components) for more details.

## Maintenance Commands

### Upgrade Components

Keep your ProofKit components up to date with the upgrade command:

<CliCommand command="proofkit upgrade" />

This command helps you maintain your ProofKit project by:

- Updating cursor rules to the latest version
- Ensuring your project has the latest component configurations
- Synchronizing project settings with the latest ProofKit standards

Run this command periodically to ensure your project stays current with the latest ProofKit features and improvements.

### Deploy
