- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
  - To check if you have already have Node installed, run `node -v` in your terminal. It will return the version number if already installed.
  - If not, download and install here: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or similar IDE)
- git (download [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) if you've never used git before)
  - To check if you have git installed, run `git -v` in your terminal. It will return the version number if already installed.
- _(suggested)_ [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
