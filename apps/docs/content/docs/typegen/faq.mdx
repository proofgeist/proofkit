### I don't like the way the code is generated. Can I edit the generated files?

Editing the generated files (in the `client` and `generated` directories) is not reccommended as it would undermine the main benefit of being able to re-run the script at a later date when the schema changesâ€”all your edits would be overritten. You can and should edit the files in the root of your specified directory if you need some custom overrides.

### Why are number fields typed as a `string | number`?

FileMaker may return numbers as strings in certain cases (such as very large numbers in scientific notation or blank fields). This ensures you properly account for this in your frontend code. If you wish to force all numbers to be typed as `number | null`, you can enable the `strictNumbers` flag per layout in your definition.

**WARNING:** the `strictNumbers` setting is disabled by default because it may result in false types if you are not using Zod or the auto-generated layout specific client. It works by applying a transformer to the zod schema to force all number fields to be either `number` or `null`.

### How does the code generation handle Value Lists?

Values lists are exported as their own types within the schema file, but they are not enforced within the schema by default because the actual data in the field may not be fully validated.

If you want the type to be enforced to a value from the value list, you can enable the `strictValueLists` flag per schema in your definition. This feature is only reccommended when you're also using the Zod library, as your returned data will fail the validation if the value is not in the value list.

### What about date/time/timestamp fields?

For now, these are all typed as strings. You probably want to transform these values anyway, so we keep it simple at the automated level.

### Why Zod instead of just TypeScript?

**In short:** Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. When you use it, you get _runtime_ validation of your data instead of just compile-time validation.

FileMaker is great for being able to change schema very quickly and easily. Yes, you probably have naming conventions in place that help protect against these changes in your web apps, but no system is perfect. Zod lets you start with the assumption that any data coming from an external API might be in a format that you don't expect and then valdiates it so that you can catch errors early. This allows the typed object that it returns to you to be much more trusted throughout your app.

**But wait, does this mean that I might get a fatal error in my production app if the FileMaker schema changes?** Yes, yes it does. This is actually what you'd want to happen. Without validating the data returned from an API, it's possible to get other unexpcted side-effects in your app that don't present as errors, which may lead to bugs that are hard to track down or inconsistencies in your data.
