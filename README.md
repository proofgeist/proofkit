# ProofKit Monorepo

ProofKit is a collection of TypeScript tools and libraries for building modern web applications, with a focus on seamless integration with Claris FileMaker. It includes CLI utilities, API clients, type generators, and other resources to help scaffold and develop TypeScript projects. ProofKit aims to make web development easier for beginners and more efficient for experienced developers by providing an opinionated project structure, code-mod scripts, and a suite of libraries to help you build, extend, and maintain your apps over time. This monorepo is where the ProofKit tools are developed and maintained.
