{"id":"proofkit-137","title":"Fix CLI scaffold missing component files","description":"## CLI Scaffold Missing Component Files\n\n**Test:** `@proofkit/cli` \u003e `browser-apps.test.ts` \u003e 'should create a project with FileMaker integration in CI mode'\n\n**Reproduced locally:** Yes (after deleting stale `packages/tmp/cli-tests/test-fm-project`)\n\n### Missing 3 components:\n1. `src/components/mode-toggle.tsx` - imported by `slot-header-right.tsx:4`\n2. `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx` - imported by `providers.tsx:4`\n3. `src/components/ui/button.tsx` - imported by `page.tsx:11`\n\n### Root cause:\nCLI scaffolding generates code that imports these shadcn/ui-style components but doesn't include the actual component files in the generated project.\n\n### Why it appeared to pass locally before:\nStale `test-fm-project` dir existed from previous runs. Turbo may have cached 'passed' result based on old inputs. Fresh scaffold exposes the missing files.\n\n### Fix needed:\nEnsure CLI registry/templates include all required UI components that generated code imports. Check:\n- `packages/registry/` for component definitions\n- CLI scaffold logic that copies/generates components\n\n### Additional warnings (non-blocking):\n```\nWarning: Invalid input options - For the \"define\". Invalid key: Expected never but received \"define\".\n```\nThis vitest config warning appears twice but doesn't cause failure.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-10T13:34:47.060701-06:00","created_by":"ericluce","updated_at":"2026-01-10T13:40:47.804511-06:00"}
